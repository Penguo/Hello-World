#### Features

- Paste any url in the text field and click save
- Next, press any key, that key is now linked to that url
- The widget can open URLs from the omnibox or from the Launchpad
- Each key can only have 1 url, if you hotlink the same key, previous links are overwritten
- Using the omnibox:
  - In the omnibox (the url bar at the top of chrome), type ` \ ` then the TAB key, then type your hotkey letter 
  - A common use, from any tab (assuming `c` is linked to confluence): `command + L`, ` \ `, `TAB`, `c`
- Using the launchpad:
  - If you're already on the Launchpad page you can do the same thing (but without `TAB`): ` \ `, `c`
